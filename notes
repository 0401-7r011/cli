## The issue

If during `cf create-buildpack` the access token expires, then the command errors with an unhelpful "Invalid Auth Token" error.

## Our previously proposed solution
Try to upload the buildpack one more time.

If the upload time is >10m then the buildpack upload will never succeed. It will try twice, just to fail.

Error between messages:
"Access token expired during upload, retrying..."

## An alternate solution

Fail the first time, and with a better error message.

Suggested tip: "


1. Retry option:
  - If upload buildpack fails with InvalidAuthTokenError, display helpful error, retry once, and then show better InvalidAuthTokenError on failure

2. More helpful error message option:
  - If upload buildpack fails with InvalidAuthTokenError, provide detailed error message and TIP to avoid.
  - "TIP: consider using `cf auth --client-credentials` to get an auth token with longer exipiry"
